### 1. Two Sum
/**
 * Problem: Two Sum
 * 
 * Description:
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers in the array
 * that add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
 * and you may not use the same element twice.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]
 * 
 * Approach:

 * 2. For each number x, check if target - x exists in map
 * 3. If found, return current index and stored index
 * 4. If not, store current number and index
